/*:
4. What‚Äôs the difference between Struct and Class ?
 
Ans:
 
Classes have additional capabilities that structures don't have:
 
‚ñ∂Ô∏é Classes can inherit the characteristics of another classes. (Inheritance)

‚ñ∂Ô∏é We can check and interpret the type of a class instance at runtime. (Type Casting)

‚ñ∂Ô∏é Clasess can use deinitializers to free up any resources which has been assigned. (Deinitialization)
 
‚ñ∂Ô∏é More than one reference to a class instance is allowed. (Reference Counting)
 */
 
/*:
5. What‚Äôs the difference between instance method and type method ?
 
Ans:
 
Instance methods are methods that we can call on an instance of a particular type(classes, structures, enumerations). An instance method can be called only on a specific instance of the type it belongs to. It can‚Äôt be called in isolation without an existing instance.
For example:
 */
class Counter {
    var count = 0
    func increment() {
        count += 1
    }
} // The counter class defines instance method: increament()

let counter = Counter() // Create an instance namsed "counter" of Counter, and the initial counter value is 0.
counter.increment() // Call instance method, and the counter's value is now 1.
/*:
Type methods call on the type itself. We indicate type methods by writing the `static` before `func`.  Classes can use the class keyword instead, to allow subclasses to override the superclass‚Äôs implementation of that method. For example:
*/
class SomeClass {
    class func someTypeMethod() {
        // type method details here
    }
}
SomeClass.someTypeMethod()

/*:
Type methods are called with dot syntax, like instance methods. However, we call type methods on the type, not on an instance of that type.
*/

/*:
6. What does an initializer do in class and struct ?
 
Ans:

Initializers set up initial state for the instances. All structures have an automatically generated memberwise initializer. Unlike structures, class instances don‚Äôt receive a default memberwise initializer.
*/

/*:
7. What does self mean in an instance method and a type method ?
 
Ans:
 
In instance methods, `self` refers to instance itself.
 
Within the body of a type method, the implicit self property refers to the type itself, rather than an instance of that type.
 
*/
/*:
8. What‚Äôs the difference between reference type and value type ?
 
Ans:
 
Reference types copy a reference, implicitly creates a shared instance. For example:
 */
class C { var data: Int = -1 }
var x = C()
var y = x                        // x is copied to y
x.data = 42                      // changes the instance referred to by x (and y)
print("\(x.data), \(y.data)")    // prints "42, 42"

/*:
Value types creates an independent instance with its own unique copy of its data: For example:
*/
// Value type example
struct S { var data: Int = -1 }
var a = S()
var b = a                        // a is copied to b
a.data = 42                      // Changes a, not b
print("\(a.data), \(b.data)")    // prints "42, -1"
//: [Next](@next)
